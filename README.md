# The Multi-Worm Tracker

This is (will be) the new home of the Multi-Worm Tracker, a software package to perform real time analysis of lots of small moving objects, such as _Caenorhabditis elegans_ (nematode worms) or _Drosophila melanogaster_ larvae (fruit flies) on a petri plate.

It is a work in progress as an updated version of the MWT is being created.
